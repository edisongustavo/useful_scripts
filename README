A project to download files from mp3skull.com

To run the script, run:

	mp3skull.sh <search_query>

For example:
	mp3skull.sh "Led Zeppelin"

	PS.: Note that since "Led Zeppelin" contains spaces, you must quote it

== Pre requirements ==

- Curl
- A bash shell (for awk, ls, cat, etc.)
- Python (I've coded it using 2.7)

== Internal steps ==

1. Download html list of files to 'temp/songs.html'

2. Parse this list (using python) and generate the file 'temp/urls.txt'
   
   This file consists of a list of files in the folowing format:
   	
	File name >>> url

   Example:
   	
	Bicho De Pe - Eu E Voce >>> http://dc167.4shared.com/img/769002351/414c338c/dlink__2Fdownload_2F77JyGX4m_3Ftsid_3D20110905-32517-78424630/preview.mp3

3. Download each file using curl. If the download fails (by downloading a 0kb file) the file is logged into 'log.txt' and removed from disk
